\section{Problem Statement}
Given the analysis conducted on pen and paper systems, and the analysis of Final Fantasy, the group reached the following problem statement:
\\
The target group is roleplayers with little to no experience with programming, the language should provide these people with a way to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Describe characters with layout resembling a regular character sheet from pen and paper roleplaying, for ease of learning.
\item Describe abilities and resources vital to these characters and
\item Describe behaviour of the characters, to give the characters personality and for example show whether they are offensive or defensive.
\end{itemize}

In order for the language to be easy to use, it should not have the users working with imperative statements, but simply describing what they would like to happen.
