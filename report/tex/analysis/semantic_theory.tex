\section{Semantics theory}\label{sec:semantic}
\emph{''Programming language semantics is the study of mathematical models of and methods for describing and reasoning about the behaviour of programs.''}\cite{transtrees}\\
The before citation pretty much sums up the whole meaning of semantics, in detail it means that programming language semantics describe the inner workings of a program in a mathematical form.\\
Two forms of operational semantics are generally used when describing program behaviour, \emph{Natural semantics} also known as ''Big-step'' and \emph{Structural operational semantics} also known as ''Small-step''.
Natural semantics describe an entire computation in a single transition;
$ \gamma \rightarrow \gamma' $.
Where $\gamma'$ is always a terminal configuration.
Structural operational semantics describe a single step of a larger computation in a transition and the $ \gamma' $ is not necessarily a terminal configuration.\\
Both have their pros and cons, Natural semantics are easier to formulate than the other, sacrificing details in the process and not able to describe non-terminating programs. Structural operational semantics can be quite complex to formulate and in contrast to Natural semantics, have detail and describe all types of programs terminating or non-terminating.\cite{opsemantics}\cite{transtrees}
