\section{Language syntax}

The programming language `RPG-script' is designed, such that it can be used to define a character, ability, attributes, resources, items and behaviour belonging to the character. Besides the user of the language can define events, which are triggered by some conditions and uses some ability, e.g. 

\begin{quote}
	let's say that the trigger is when health goes below 50 \% \\
	and let's say that the condition is health below 50\% \\
	and let's say that the ability is `FireBall' \\
\end{quote}

In the example above, the character would fire a `FireBall' as long as its health would be below 50 \%, when its health goes above 50 \% the the event would no longer be triggered. \\
Written in code of the `RPG-script' language the event would look like
