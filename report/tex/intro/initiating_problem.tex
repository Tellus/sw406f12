\section{Initiating problem}
The most popular languages to develop games with are object-oriented and in some cases associated with game-development tools.
The languages are mostly general-purpose languages......
These tools are generally targeted at a wide genre of games, where development teams will have to customise them, to some degree, to fit their implementation, wasting valuable development time.
A solution to this problem could be a language targeted at a specific genre, in our case role-playing games.
Which is the initiating problem.\\
In other words; \emph{The lack of role-playing focused programming languages can be a problem for developers and this should be addressed.}





%In this project, we want to design and construct our own programming language along with the tools to translate and make use of the designed language.
%This presents us with following tasks:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Designing a language
%	\item Designing a fitting grammar for the language
%	\item Designing and implementing an engine to showcase the capabilites of the language
%	\item Designing and implementing a compiler to translate the language for our engine
%\end{itemize}

%This brings us to an initial problem statement:\\
%\emph{\textbf{How do we efficiently design and implement a readible and writable language, capable of simplifying entity creation for a Role-playing game.}}
