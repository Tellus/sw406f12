\section{Initiating problem}
When it comes to game-development the work can be divided into levels.
Low-level is the basic workings of a game; physics, graphics and so on.
High-level is for example the behaviour of entities within the game world.
One of the most popular language, to construct a game-engine with is C++, which is `multi-paradigm' and a `general purpose'-kind language, meaning that it is created with general software development in mind.

For the languages that are `general-purpose', frameworks are created to extend the functionality of each language, so that the various aspects of a video game are handled correctly and efficiently.
This means that countless hours of work are spent to extend functionality of a language, not tailored for this specific task, and the construction of game-engines is needed to save developers time on the low-level implementation.

The problem here is that there are few to none programming languages created solely for video game development, and as the before-mentioned tools and frameworks indicate, these kinds of languages would be beneficial to game-developers.
Since computer \ac{rpgs} are popular throughout the world, an RPG-focused programming language could be a good place to start.\cite{esa_pdf}
This leads to the initiating problem.

\emph{"There is currently no language specialised in describing turn-based battles in computer role-playing games}

\emph{"While the game-development industry is continuously growing and role-playing games are so popular, why isn't there an RPG-based programming language available?"}

%TODO Needs refurbishing, comments for fixes below....

%Why is it necessary to program imperative to develop games?
%Tala um low-level (c++ game engine stuff)
%Tala um high-level (scripting.. .sem er -það sem við erum að gera)

%In this project, we want to design and construct our own programming language along with the tools to translate and make use of the designed language.
%This presents us with following tasks:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Designing a language
%	\item Designing a fitting grammar for the language
%	\item Designing and implementing an engine to showcase the capabilites of the language
%	\item Designing and implementing a compiler to translate the language for our engine
%\end{itemize}

%This brings us to an initial problem statement:\\
%\emph{\textbf{How do we efficiently design and implement a readible and writable language, capable of simplifying entity creation for a Role-playing game.}}
