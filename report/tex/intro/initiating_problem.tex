\section{Initiating problem}
Combat scenarios are an integral part of many role-playing systems and games, but there are no languages that allow roleplayers with no programming experience to write and execute combat situations on their computers. 

This leads to the following initial problem:

\emph{"There is currently no language specialised in describing turn-based battles in computer role-playing games}
\begin{comment}
\emph{"While the game-development industry is continuously growing and role-playing games are so popular, why isn't there an RPG-based programming language available?"}
\end{comment}

%TODO Needs refurbishing, comments for fixes below....

%
%Why is it necessary to program imperative to develop games?
%Tala um low-level (c++ game engine stuff)
%Tala um high-level (scripting.. .sem er -það sem við erum að gera)

%In this project, we want to design and construct our own programming language along with the tools to translate and make use of the designed language.
%This presents us with following tasks:
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Designing a language
%	\item Designing a fitting grammar for the language
%	\item Designing and implementing an engine to showcase the capabilites of the language
%	\item Designing and implementing a compiler to translate the language for our engine
%\end{itemize}

%This brings us to an initial problem statement:\\
%\emph{\textbf{How do we efficiently design and implement a readible and writable language, capable of simplifying entity creation for a Role-playing game.}}
