To communicate with a computer, one is required to 'speak' the same language as the computer. A computer's language is pre-defined by the computer's producer, and is referred to generally as \emph{machine code} or \emph{machine instructions}.\\
Today software developers make use of various programming languages. Each language has a certain purpose, although some have been created more as a joke than a functional language. These languages have to be translated for the computer and this is generally done with tools called compilers.\\
When developing, the choice of programming language can be vital to the project's success and functionality.\\\\
In this report, a description of the development-process of a new language is laid out.

\section{\langname{}}
In this project we want to address the interest for a role-playing based language. The purpose of the language is to define entities, found in various role-playing games, these include characters, skills and more.\\
To do this we construct a language which should catch the intuitive and simple characteristics of character sheets, which are information containers for various role-playing games.

\section{Role-playing}
Role-playing games have been around for some time now and exist in many forms.
These include \emph{Computer role-playing}- and \emph{Pen \& Paper role-playing-games}, both a focus in this project.\\
The game \emph{Dungeons \& Dragons} was first published in 1974 and is the first modern \emph{Pen \& Paper role-playing game} to be released commercially.\cite{wikidnd}
In role-playing games, players take on the roles of fictitious characters, either created by the players themselves or by the developers of the game.
\subsection*{Pen \& Paper}
When playing \emph{Pen \& Paper games} (also known as 'tabletop') the players generally use dice (see figure \vref{dice}) to determine an outcome of an activity. To help keep track of a character's attributes and other information, a character sheet is used.
As the name inclines writing tools and something to write on is required (character sheets are generally printed on a piece of paper).

\subsection*{Digitised}
In \emph{Computer role-playing games} the outcome of an activity is determined by measures implemented by the developers, this can be an imitation of a dice roll (variation) or a static calculation (pre-calculated).
To keep track of character information, a digitised character sheet is often accessible, where the player can customise his character to some degree.\\
Due to the increasing popularity of role-playing games, the benefit of a role-playing based programming language becomes greater.
