\section{Language semantics}
The language is a language used for  of a role-playing characters. I addiction to the language is an battle engine, which simulates a battle between the  character. \\
The engine works, so that lets one character make an action, then the turn end, and the other character then gets to make its action. \\
The action a character makes, is calculated by an AI-behaviour. The AI-behaviour is base at a behaviour declared for the character. \\
Before a character gets to make its turn, win condition is checked, so that the character does not get to make an action if its health is below zero.  

\subsection{Environment-store model}
The semantics of the language is base at the environment-store model, which is a a model describing how variables are bound during a program execution. Each variable is bound to a storage cell, and the content of the storage cell is the value of the variable.

\subsection{\langname{} semantics}
Five parts are highlighted for semantic description, these are  \emph{Declaration}, \emph{Turn}, \emph{AI}, \emph{Action} and \emph{Wincon}.\\
The first one 'Declaration' is the main function of \langname{} and the four that follow are not included in the language itself but in the engine.
A turn is a character takes an action, based at the outcome of the AI calculation \\
AI is calculation, which simulates every possible outcome, based on the possible actions a character can make. \\
Action is an event, which will make change for the stored values of the enemy character, or the character itself.\\
Wincon is a conditional check to see if the \emph{winning condition} is met.\\\\

The semantics for the relevant parts of \langname{} are defined as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $EnvD$ is a declaration-environment
	\item $env_{D}$ is an element in the set $EnvD$
	\item $EnvC$ is a character-environment
	\item $env_{c}$ is an element in the set $EnvC$
	\item $StoreS$ is a set of locations and their bindings
	\item $sto$ is an element in the set $Stores$
	\item $Pending$ is a list of pending characters
	\item $ActioN$ is a set of available actions
	\item $act$ is an element in the set $ActioN$
\end{itemize}

The rules for the five parts are as follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c }
\textbf{Declaration}\\
\hline
 \\
$\langle env_{D}, env_{C}, sto \rangle \rightarrow$\\
$\langle env_{C}', sto' \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The transitions system for declarations is $(\Gamma_{DV}, \rightarrow_{DV}, T_{DV})$, whose configurations are defined by \\
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
$\Gamma_{DV}$ & $=$ & $(EnvD \times EnvC \times StoreS) \cup (EnvD, StoreS),$ \\
$T_{DV}$ & $=$ & $EnvC \times StoreS$ \\
\end{tabular}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Turn}}\\
\hline
 & \\
$\langle Pending, env_{C}, sto \rangle \Rightarrow$ & \\
$\langle Pending', env_{C}, sto \rangle$ & $\text{if wincon } \rightarrow_{b} ff$\\
 & \\
$\langle Pending, env_{C}, sto \rangle \Rightarrow$ & \\
$\langle Pending, env_{C}, sto \rangle$ & $\text{if wincon } \rightarrow_{b} tt$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The transition system for turns is $(\Gamma_{TURN}, \Rightarrow_{TURN}, T_{TUNR})$, whose configurations are defined by\\
\\
\begin{tabular}{l l l }
$\Gamma_{TURN}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS)$ \\
$T_{TURN}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS)$\\
\end{tabular}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c }
\textbf{AI}\\
\hline
 \\
$\langle Pending, env_{C}, sto, Action \rangle \Rightarrow$\\
$\langle Pending, env_{C}, sto, act \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The transition system for AI is $(\Gamma_{AI}, \Rightarrow_{AI}, T_{AI})$, whose configurations are defined by \\
\begin{tabular}{l l l }
$\Gamma_{AI}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS \times ActioN)$ \\
$T_{AI}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS \times ActioN)$ \\

\end{tabular}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c }
\textbf{Action}\\
\hline
 \\
$\langle env_{C}, Pending, sto, act \rangle \Rightarrow$\\
$\langle env_{C}, Pending, sto', act \rangle$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
The transition system for Action is $(\Gamma_{ACT}, \Rightarrow_{ACT}, T_{ACT})$, whose configurations are defined by \\
\begin{tabular}{l l l }
$\Gamma_{ACT}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS \times ActioN)$ \\
$T_{ACT}$ & $=$ & $(Pending \times EnvC \times StoreS \times ActioN)$ \\

\end{tabular}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ l l }
\multicolumn{2}{c}{\textbf{Wincon}}\\
\hline
 & \\
$\dfrac{env_{C} \vdash c \rightarrow_{h} h}{\text{win} \rightarrow_{b} ff}$ & $\text{if } h > 0$\\
 & \\
$\dfrac{env_{C} \vdash c \rightarrow_{h} h}{\text{win} \rightarrow_{b} tt}$ & $\text{if } h \leq 0$\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
Wincon is special, because it is a boolean expression. \\
The rules evaluates true, if the demanded character $c$, has health evaluating to the value $h$, and the value is less or equal to zero, else et evaluates false, and the game will the continue
