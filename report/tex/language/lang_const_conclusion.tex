\subsection{Conclusion}

The reasoning for this minimalist approach is three-fold. Firstly, it results in increased writability/readability from the reduction of identifiers that need document referencing and memorization. Secondly, it vastly simplifies the style of writing for the definitions, much closer matching those of the character sheets that inspired them. Finally, the meticulous syntactical design creates a basis from which a much simpler language syntax is possible, allowing for an efficient compiler construction.
