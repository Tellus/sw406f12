%\langname{} has taken on traits of declarative programming languages that focuses on letting the programmer describe \emph{what} they want, but not necessarily \emph{how}. It is evident in the three basic interaction methods in the language: \emph{declaration}, \emph{assignment} and \emph{construction}.
All three are demonstrated in the following snippet. %\todo{Double check the syntax for Fireball.Costs - I can't remember how we referenced members like that.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=fflang]
make Cure from Ability
{
	mana_cost: 10;
	targets: [self];
	effects: [
				[Heal(target, 20)]
			 ];
}
\end{lstlisting}

The user-defined Ability, \emph{Cure}, is declared and its members are assigned the necessary values. Notice the syntax for the effects ($<EffectName>(<RGR>,<magnitude>)$), reminiscent of procedure calls in many other languages. This code is all that is necessary in order to implement Cure into the game and make it available to characters.
While not strictly adherent to any single rule system, each base type in the language models a particular part of systems that was deemed almost universal across those reviewed. For example, many abilities of characters have a cost associated with them, especially magic abilities like Cure, which replenish \ac{hp}. %TODO: Acronym?
%As an example, 4th edition of \ac{dnd} limits the number of times an ability, can be used as a number of times per game day, encounter (battle) or ``at will'' (without restriction). Both types should be possible with the generalised assignment method and should thus cater to many different systems \todo{Test/confirm/analyse/look}. All other base types contain similar members (see the language reference for full descriptions).
The type members and the method of declaration attempts to mimic the filling out of character sheets (see appendix \vref{charsheet} for an example) in pen and paper role-playing games. When a player or \ac{gm} fills out a character sheet they will, line for line, write the values of the character in appropriate fields. These are erased and updated as necessary, for example, when the character takes damage.
Likewise, the programmer details the character as they should appear at the beginning of a battle according to a pre-defined rule set, which defines which types of Attribute, Resources and Effect are available during a battle.
%This philosophy data-driven programming is further described within the context of several key areas of programming in the following sections.
