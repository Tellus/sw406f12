% So... what did we learn?

Based on a comprehensive introduction to \langname{}, the basic language features lay ground for further technical work. In particular, the three basic concepts of the language. \emph{Declaration} of Primarch subtypes. \emph{Assignment} of values to lists or Primarch members. \emph{Construction} of Effects.

Combined with a cursory analysis of the target user group this resulted in a syntax tailored to fit the form-filling norms already found in many \ac{rpg} circles. Coupled with some syntactic considerations, this yields a language that is sufficiently easy to work with to the user as well as to the compiler.

Finally, the semantic description of \langname{} and its engine supplies the exacting details necessary to make a reference implementation of compiler and engine.
