\subsection{Inclusions}
A feature of primarch and seed definitions, inclusions \todo{proper term?} is a notation to define a member of a primarch without explicitly instantiating with an identifier. An example:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=fflang]
make Fireball from Ability
{
	targets: [target];
	cost: [[owner.mana, 10]];
	effects: [	FireDamage(target,5,12),
				BurnDOT(target,5,2 to 5)
			 ];
}

make Heal from Ability
{
	targets: [owner];
	cost   : [[owner.mana, 7]];
	effects: [Heal(target,2d8)];
}

make BattleMageBehaviour from Behaviour
{
	positive : [[owner.health, 70]];
	negative : [[team.enemy.health, 80]];
}

make Wizard from Character
{
	abilities : [Fireball, Heal, Attack];
	behaviour : BattleMageBehaviour;
	events    : [ ];
	items     : [ ];
                 
    strength: 8;
    agility: 8;
    intelligence: 21;
    
    health: 80;
    mana: 100;
}
\end{lstlisting}

In this example, we transcend Wizard from the Primarch Character, assigning new abilities and setting the value of attributes and resources as well as a proper behaviour. Notice that unlike imperative languages, only the type is given - no identifiers are necessary, since each entry of the type is considered unique (it is impossible to have two ''strength'' attributes on the same character.
