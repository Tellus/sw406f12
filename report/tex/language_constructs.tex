\section{Language constructs}
The InvaderScript/ELFIE language has resulted in a generally declarative style of programming, focusing on what is to be done, but not how. While several of the concepts are widely used (events/signaling, class definitions, constructors, function calls), they have been modified to more specifically target the domain of role-playing games. This chapter focuses on describing and arguing these constructs, their purpose, usage and reasoning.

\subsection{Class definitions}
The \emph{core} and \emph{make} \todo{Possibly not make anymore.} keywords define a form of inheritance from the language's core classes (called primarchs).
