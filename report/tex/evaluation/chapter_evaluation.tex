\chapter{Evaluation}
%Evaluate evaluate ! Don't worry just keep testing...
In this chapter the different phases of the project is evaluated, along with an overall evaluation of the project process.

\subsection{Analysis}
The analysis was started too late and ended too early. The problem statement and the initiating problem was not properly defined to start with. This made the report lose focus and a lot of effort was wasted on things that were later scrapped. As an example, the target group was redefined two times, which meant that analytic work related to earlier target groups had to be redone.
The choice of paradigm was never properly discussed until the design phase, which ended up being quite the hindrance to good design.

\subsection{Design}
The design of the language was started too early in the process, but too late with regards to time. The analysis was not done by the time design started, and this meant that some syntax was suddenly deprecated and some was plain wrong when considering the target group. The choice of paradigm also opened up problems, seeing as the group only had experience with object-oriented and imperative paradigms. The paradigm also did not fully support what the group initially wished to describe in the language. This meant workaround solutions to have the syntax fit in the proper paradigm instead of simply writing it the easiest way.

The final design, however, closely resembles what the target group is used to seeing in pen and paper roleplaying when creating characters, which should make it easy to learn and use. Definition of behaviour, which does not occur on character sheets, is simple and straightforward, and the overall design, though limited in comparison to the initial idea, turned out fine.

\subsection{Implementation}
The implementation was the most rushed part of the project in total. The process was started so late the group at one point was even worried it might not be done in time. This led to code which is more inefficient and slow than it could be, but all the desired functionality is implemented which was a success to the group.

\subsection{Overall evaluation}

All in all, the group feels that the project could have been better with better project planning and a better distribution of group roles. Seeing as the group work was marked by too few people, having 2 group members departing early in the process, the workload was heavier than it could have been, however the group worked hard and still achieved their goals.
\vspace{10pt}
The group felt that the group contract was very good, but the upholding of the group contract was lacking, especially nearing the end of the semester. The group received excellent supervision along the way, and the weekly meetings with the supervisor was a great motivator to have things done.
