\chapter*{Preface}
The following report has been made as a part of the SW3 project for the second-year students of software engineering at Aalborg University. The report is based upon the project proposals given to the students at the beginning of the semester and written in parallel with the lectures \emph{Algorithms and Data Structures}, \emph{Systems Development and Design}, \emph{Implementation and Evaluation of User Interfaces}. Source material can be found in the last part of the report.

The group would like to thank the Kindergarten Birken and their kindergarten teacher Kristine Niss-Henriksen for her participation in this project. This report and product is an expansion of the multi-project from spring 2011 made by the groups: s601a, s601b, s601c and s601e, and we want to thank these groups for the pre-work. Finally, we want to thank our supervisor Ulrik Nyman, for his continued envolvment and support during this process.
