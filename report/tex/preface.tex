\chapter*{Preface}
The following report has been made as a part of the SW4 project for the second-year students of software engineering at Aalborg University. The report is based upon the project proposals given to the students at the beginning of the semester and written in parallel with the lectures \emph{Languages and Compilers}, \emph{Principles of Operating Systems and Concurrency} and \emph{Syntax and Semantics}. Source material can be found in the last part of the report.
The reader is expected to have a basic understanding of set notation, semantic notation and object-oriented programming.

The group would like to thank their supervisor Danny Bøgsted Poulsen for guidance and help along the way, and White Wolf Entertainment for the use of the World of Darkness character sheet.
